# [Project 1: Dognition Data Final Project](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sankalp.chauhan5511#!/vizhome/CourseraTableauFinalDognitionAnalysis/Story1)
## Overview
This is the assignment I had to do for the final assignment for my Coursera Course Data 
Visulization and Communication with Tableau.
I was given a Dognition Data Set and had to create a Tableau visulization 
for how to improve employment
at the Dognition service. In order to do this I made several graphs and charts:
I made a line chart showcasing the different memberships for the sign in count
for the years 2013,2014, and 2015, I made a map of the dognition data based on 
breed type and gender, a circle chart of the cities with breeds,a bar graph with
breed type, breed group, and male/female, and a bar chart showcasing the games played.
Then I wrote the reccomendations for how to improve the service.

# [Project 2: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) project]
## Overview
In this assignment I created a mulitiwindow Shiny application in R programming to map 
the trees in New York City (NYC) and color the map by the health of the tree and 
when someone clicks on a tree point, we get a panaormic street view
of the tree as well as a wikipedia page about the tree. 
In this project I also had a controller which filters the tree
based on the species of the tree, the zip code of the tree, and 
the health of the tree. Basically in this project I created
an interactive Shiny application that was able to display 
a lot of information at once as well as 
having a lot of applications done at once. 
I then wrote a report as well as a poster.

# [Project 3: Computational Optimization Final Project](https://github.com/Sankalp1233/Computational-Optimization-Final-Project)
## Overview
In this project I developed two augmented lagrangian method (ALM) solvers,
and wrote a report to explain the reuslts I got, how I derived the solver,
and the observations I made from the results. For the first topic my goal was
to find a hyperplane that seprates two classes of data points. I wanted to find
a hyperplane that had a maximum margin between two classes. I also tested my 
classification by getting an accuracy on the testing set and reporting the 
accuracy I obtain. For the second topic my goal was to develop an 
augmented lagrangian method solver that minimizes false negative error
(a result that shows a negative data point when it should be a positive
data point) while controlling for false positive error (a result that 
shows a positive data point when it should be a negative data point). I
used LATEX in order to write the report.
