# [Project 1: Dognition Data Final Project](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sankalp.chauhan5511#!/vizhome/CourseraTableauFinalDognitionAnalysis/Story1)
## Overview
This is the assignment I had to do for the final assignment for my Coursera Course Data 
Visulization and Communication with Tableau.
I was given a Dognition Data Set and had to create a Tableau visulization 
for how to improve employment
at the Dognition service. In order to do this I made several graphs and charts:
I made a line chart showcasing the different memberships for the sign in count
for the years 2013,2014, and 2015, I made a map of the dognition data based on 
breed type and gender, a circle chart of the cities with breeds,a bar graph with
breed type, breed group, and male/female, and a bar chart showcasing the games played.
Then I wrote the reccomendations for how to improve service.
